## Database Setup

### Supabase Configuration

1. Create a Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Set up the following tables:

**Puzzles**
```sql
CREATE TABLE puzzles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  emojis TEXT NOT NULL,
  answer TEXT NOT NULL,
  category TEXT NOT NULL,
  used BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  used_date DATE,
  active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**User Attemps**
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_puzzle_attempts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  device_id TEXT,
  puzzle_id UUID REFERENCES puzzles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  date DATE,
  completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  attempts_count INT4 DEFAULT 0,
  attempts_data JSONB,
  time_to_solve INT4,
  shared BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);
```

**Feedbacks**
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.feedback (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  device_id VARCHAR(255),
  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'new',
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

3. Create a `.env` file with your Supabase details:
   ```
   REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
   REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
   ```

## Game Logic

- Each day presents a new, randomly selected unused puzzle
- Players get 6 attempts to guess the correct answer
- Feedback is provided for each guess:
  - ‚úÖ Correct: The answer matches exactly
  - üîÑ Partially correct: Some elements of the answer are right
  - ‚ùå Incorrect: The answer is wrong
- Optional hints are available if players are stuck
- Game progress is saved to continue across sessions
